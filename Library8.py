# Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates
# for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee
# structure is as follows:
# 1.
# If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will
# be charged (i.e.: fine = 0).
# 2.
# If the book is returned after the expected return. but still within the same
# calendar month and year as the expected return date, fine = Rs.15 * number of
# days late.
# 3.
# If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the
# same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine = Rs.500 * number of
# days late.
# 4.
# If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected,
# there is a fixed fine of Rs.10,000.



# actual_return=int(input("Enter the actual return date:"))
# expected_return=int(input("Enter the expected date:"))
# if actual_return>=expected_return:
#     fine=0
# elif actual_return<=expected_return:
#     fine=(15*actual_return-expected_return)
#     if actual_return<=expected_return:
#         fine=(500*actual_return-expected_return)
#     elif actual_return<expected_return:
#         fine=(10,000)
# print(fine)
